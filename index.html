                + From 1996 to 1997, there was a very high GDP growth rate, the average threshold was about 8.7%. </br>
                + From 1998 to 2019, Vietnam had a stable GDP growth rate of nearly 6%/year. In particular, in the 
                period 2016 - 2019 GDP grew at an average rate of 7%/year </br>
                + Although 2020 and 2021 are heavily affected by the Covid-19 epidemic, Vietnam's economy still grows

                + The gross capital formation contributes approximately one-third of the country's total GDP. It reached its peak at 39.6% in 2007 and remained stable until 2010. Afterward, it slightly decreased but remained 
                stable until 2021. </br>
                + Trade: The trend in trade has been unstable, with sudden increases and decreases. It reached its peak in 2007 when Vietnam joined the World Trade Organization (WTO), and it hit a low point in 2010 due to 
                the global financial crisis, which affected the global economy as a whole. </br>

              <p>
                + After using linear regression, the variables that are correlated with GDP (current US$) are Population, Labor Force, Unemployment and Trade. </br>
                + Population and labor force have a strong positive correlation with GDP. The regression results indicate that the R-Squared value for both of these variables is around 0.9, which means that this linear regression model explains about 90% of the variation in GDP. </br>
                + Trade also has a positive correlation with GDP. This can be explained by the fact that when the trade-to-GDP ratio of a country increases, it indicates a higher level of international trade activities, expanding the market opportunities and earning more foreign currency with a higher conversion value, thereby contributing to GDP growth.</br>
                + The unemployment rate within the labor force has a negative correlation with GDP.</br>

                + During the period from 1992 to 1997, the economic growth rate increased to 8.77% per year, which was double the rate compared to the previous period. Inflation also decreased significantly. This is why 
                1996 and 1997 had very high GDP growth rates. </br>
                + The economic growth continued to increase from 2002 to 2007, thanks to new policies implemented. In
